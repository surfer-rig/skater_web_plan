                <h2>The Future of Skate Clothes</h2>
                <p>Skaters have long since had a signature style of clothing and because of that it has been easy for skate brands to know just what type of clothes to market to the skate comunity. New skateboard brands come and go based on what niche type of graphic is popular amoungst different groups and it's usually hard for them to survive after they go out of style. With Foatch Skateboarding that will be different. </p>

                <h2>Creativity</h2>
                <p>Skaters have also long since used thier creativity in their skateboarding and in their style choices as well. Many skaters like to make their own art and dream of making their own clothes with their logos on them. With Foatch you'll be able to send your graphics to us and if we really like them you could have the chance for them to be made into real clothes that you would be able to buy or even recieve some of the profits from. </p>
